This repository contains a Lua code example demonstrating a common error related to nil checks and function calls.  The `foo` function checks for `nil` input, but calling it without an argument still throws an error due to Lua's behavior when accessing non-existent parameters.

The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this scenario using different approaches.
